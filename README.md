# Screw-Classifier
This project uses machine learning and computer vision in MATLAB to classify screws into 3 types based on training images of the screws.

The Classify_Screws.m file will run with no command line arguments. However, there is a boolean present one line 6 that specifies whether the model should be trained again or not.
A trained model is included, named classifier.m.

Training and testing image files are included.
